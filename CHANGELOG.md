# Changelog

## 4.0.0 (2022/02/19)

- Dependency updates; pg-to-ts should now work with Node 14+.
- Officially dropped support for Node 6.
- Remove `export namespace every` variants of `enum` types (it's unclear to me how these were ever intended to work).
- Added types for enum arrays (previously they were typed to `any`, now they're typed to `EnumType[]`).
- Changed the prefix for environment variables from `SCHEMATS` â†’ `PG_TO_TS` and documented how to use them.
- Changed the default config file name from `schemats.json` to `pg-to-ts.json`.
- Significantly modernize tooling; unit tests now run via GitHub actions and post code coverage.

## 3.7.1 (2021/10/19)

- Make TypeScript a peer dependency, rather than a direct dependency.

## 3.6.0 (2021/03/18)

- Added `--jsonTypesFile` option.
- Rewrote `README.md` and renamed the repo to `pg-to-ts` to match the name on npm.
